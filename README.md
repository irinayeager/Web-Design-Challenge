### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `Web-Design-Challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, add your **html** files, as well as your **assets**, **Resources** and **visualizations** folders. Your `index.html` should be the landing page that the user first sees.

4. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

5. Deploy to GitHub Pages.
